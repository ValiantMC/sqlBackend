# sqlBackend
A SQL based backend which uses JDBI to provide cached objects.


It provides an example, but the idea is you would be able to change the backend :). The main concept is to provide a way to allow records to be accessed without blowing up the server ;) (like spammers) but also when highly secure data needs is the ability to pull the latest and push.
(For example money transactions)

This is totally a personal project and you should be careful with SQL (it burns peoples houses down. :()
